help.aboutHelpContent=<p><u>What</u>:</p><p>AvyEyes is a graphical database of avalanches.</p><p>The primary piece of data in AvyEyes is the avalanche location. The avalanche path is drawn on the map by the avalanche report submitter and displayed three-dimensionally to anyone searching for avalanches at a given location. Avalanche reports are also directly sharable/linkable with short URLs or social plugins.</p><p><span style="font-size: .9em; font-style: italic;"><u>Accuracy Disclaimer</u>: Avalanche paths in AvyEyes are drawn freehand by the report submitter using the mouse. Avalanche paths are NOT derived from GPS coordinates or any other precise form of survey/measurement. Therefore the avalanche paths displayed on AvyEyes can be assumed to contain some degree of inaccuracy resulting from the report submitter misremembering the exact path shape or rendering it inaccurately.</span></p><p><u>Why</u>:</p><p>The driving purpose behind AvyEyes is to enable people to <i>visualize</i> avalanches. By requiring the report submitter to draw the avalanche path on the map, AvyEyes records the geographic location of the avalanche. And by allowing the user to zoom, tilt, rotate, and fly around avalanches in 3D, AvyEyes gives the user a new way to look at avalanches and share avalanche reports.</p><p>AvyEyes is intended to be a collaborative and educational tool for the backcountry community. The hope is that AvyEyes will foster communication and knowledge-sharing between both novice and experienced backcountry travelers by showing which slopes have historically produced what types of avalanches.</p><p><u>Contact</u>:</p><p>Send questions, comments, or ideas for improvement to <a href='mailto:avyeyes@gmail.com'>avyeyes@gmail.com</a></p>

####### Filter #######

tooltip.avyFilterFromDate=The start date for the search. Only avalanches that occurred on or after this date will be displayed
tooltip.avyFilterToDate=The end date for the search. Only avalanches that occurred on or before this date will be displayed
tooltip.avyFilterType=SWAG classification for the type of the avalanche
tooltip.avyFilterTrigger=SWAG classification for the trigger that caused the avalanche to release. Triggers are either natural (N* codes) or artificial (A* codes)
tooltip.avyFilterInterface=SWAG classification for the interface (i.e. bed surface) on which the avalanche slid
tooltip.avyFilterRsize=The relative (R) size of the avalanche. Only avalanches that have a R-size greater than or equal to the specified value will be displayed
tooltip.avyFilterDsize=The destructive (D) size of the avalanche. Only avalanches that have a D-size greater than or equal to the specified value will be displayed

help.filterHelpContent=<h3>Geographic Filtering</h3><p>AvyEyes first filters avalanches by the geographic bounds of the current Cesium view. Only avalanches that occurred within the geographic bounds of the current view will be displayed. To view avalanches in a different area, pan or zoom the view to that location (click the ? button on the upper right for help using the Cesium view).</p><h3>Field Filtering</h3><p>Use the Avalanche Filter form on the main menu to further filter avalanches within the current view. Avalanches can be further filtered by date, SWAG classification, and R/D size. Multiple filter fields are combined with boolean <b>AND</b>, and multiple values within the same SWAG classification field are combined with boolean <b>OR</b>.</p><p>For example, selecting an Avalanche Type filter of [HS, SS] and an R-size of 2 will filter avalanches in the current view to only those that are of type Hard Slab <b>OR</b> Soft Slab, <b>AND</b> have a R-size greater than or equal to 2.</p><h3>Pins vs Paths</h3><p>Once the view is zoomed to within <b>10,000 meters</b> of any avalanche (either by clicking on an avalanche pin or zooming in manually), the pin marking that avalanche is replaced by the 3D avalanche path. Click on the red path to display the avalanche details and images of the slide.</p>
help.horizonInView=AvyEyes cannot set the geographic search bounds when the horizon is in view. The entire Cesium view must show earth.

####### Avalanche Card #######

help.avyReportStepTwoLabel=Get the Slope in View
help.avyReportStepTwoContent=Now use the mouse to zoom, tilt, and rotate the 3D view to get a close-up look at the slope.</p><p>See the Cesium navigation instructions in the upper right hand corner for help moving the view.</p><p>Once you have a close-up view of the slope, click the button below to start tracing the avalanche path.</p>

help.avyReportStepThreeLabel=Trace the Avalanche Path
help.avyReportStepThreeContent=The mouse is now set to draw. Trace the avalanche path perimeter on the 3D map.<p>The first left-click (click and release) begins the trace of the avalanche path perimeter.</p><p>A second left-click (click and release) completes the perimeter trace.</p>

help.avyReportStepFourLabel=Confirm the Drawing
help.avyReportStepFourContent=Are you satisfied with the drawing?<p>Click "Accept Drawing" to keep the current drawing and continue on to enter the avalanche details.</p><p>Click "Redraw" to erase the current drawing and try again.</p><p>You can redraw as many times as needed to get it right, but once you accept the drawing <i>it cannot be modified.</i></p>

Wind speed is measured on the Beaufort scale:</p><ul><li>Calm - less than 1 km/hour or .7 mph. Smoke rises vertically</li><li>Light breeze - 5-12 km/hour or 3-7 mph. Leaves rustle, wind vanes begin to move</li><li>Moderate breeze - 20-29 km/hour or 12-18 mph. Small branches begin to move</li><li>Strong breeze - 39-50 km/hour or 24-31 mph. Large branches in motion</li><li>Gale - 62-75 km/hour or 38-46 mph. Twigs broken from trees, progress on foot becomes difficult</li><li>Storm - 88-102 km/hour or 55-64 mph. Trees are broken off or uprooted, structural damage likely</li></ul><p>Wind direction is always the direction that the wind came <i>from</i>. For example, a NW wind blew from the northwest toward the southeast.</p>
