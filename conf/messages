msg.searchHelpContent=<p>AvyEyes is a graphical, searchable database of avalanches.</p><p>To search for avalanches, you must first zoom the view in to a specific location of interest. Use the 'Location' field on the search panel and/or the mouse controls to zoom, rotate, tilt, or pan the view. Click the '?' button in the upper right hand corner for an explanation of the mouse controls.</p><p><i>Only avalanches within the geographic bounds of the current 3D map view will be returned.</i></p><p>Additionally, the view must be zoomed to no more than 10,000 meters above the ground when searching.</p><br/><p><u>Search Fields</u></p><p><u>Dates</u>: Only avalanches that occurred within the bounding dates (inclusive of the 'from' and 'to' dates) will be returned. Leaving the 'from' date blank will return avalanches back to Jan. 1 1970; leaving the 'to' date blank will return avalanches up to today.</p><p><u>Type and Trigger</u>: If specified, only avalanches with the <i>exact</i> type and trigger codes will be returned. Leaving either field empty will return avalanches with any type or any trigger.</p><p><u>R/D size</u>: If specified, only avalanches with an R/D size <i>greater than or equal to</i> the specified value will be returned. Leaving R/D size blank will return avalanches of any size.</p><p><u>Caught and Killed Human Numbers</u>: If specified, only avalanches that caught or killed <i>greater than or equal to</i> the specified number of humans will be returned. Leaving either field empty will return avalanches that caught or killed any number of humans (including those that did not catch/kill any humans).</p><p>Each of the eight search fields may be independently specified or left blank. If multiple fields are specified, they are combined with a boolean 'AND' to produce the aggregate search criteria.</p><br/><p><u>Examples</u></p><p><u>Example 1</u>: A 'from' date of 12/1/2005 is entered along with an 'R size' of 2. All other fields are left blank.<br/><u>Result</u>: Only avalanches that occurred within the geographic bounds of the current map view on or after December 1, 2005 with an R size greater than or equal to 2 will be displayed.</p><p><u>Example 2</u>: A 'from' date of '11/25/2008', a 'to' date of '3/27/2012', a 'type' of 'HS - Hard Slab Avalanche', a 'trigger' value of 'AS - Skier' and a 'caught' value of '1' are specified. All other fields are left blank.<br/><u>Result</u>: All hard slab avalanches that occurred within the geographic bounds of the current map view between November 25, 2008 and March 27, 2012 that were skier-triggered and caught at least 1 human will be displayed.</p>
msg.reportHelpContent=<p>There are two parts to submitting an avalanche report on AvyEyes: 1) drawing the avalanche path on the 3D map and 2) entering the avalanche details.</p><p><u>Drawing the avalanche path</u>:</p><p>The primary piece of data in AvyEyes is the avalanche location, so the first part of the report process is to draw the avalanche path on the 3D map with the mouse. AvyEyes guides the report submitter through a 3-step process to draw the avalanche path:<ol><li>Step 1 is to prime the map by entering a nearby location to the avalanche. AvyEyes will fly to that location and thereby minimize the amount of manual zooming required in step 2.</li><li>Step 2 is to zoom/tilt/rotate the 3D map with the mouse to get a close-up view of the exact slope that slid.</li><li>Step 3 is trace the avalanche path perimeter with the mouse. One left-click of the mouse starts the trace and a second left-click completes the trace. After the second left-click AvyEyes will ask the report submitter to accept the drawing or choose to redraw if the drawing didn't come out right. Tracing the avalanche path takes a little practice and you can redraw as many times as needed to get the path right. However, once the drawing is accepted it cannot be modified.</li></ol></p>Here is a good example of a zoomed-in view and avalanche path drawing:<br/><br/><img src="/assets/images/example-drawing.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/></p><p><u>Entering the avalanche details</u></p><p>Once the avalanche path drawing is accepted, the avalanche detail entry screen will be displayed.<ul><li><u>Aspect, angle, and elevation</u> are pre-populated based on the drawn avalanche path. The aspect and angle are estimated based on the drawing but are also editable in case the estimated values are off. The elevation is accurate based on the drawing and is not editable.</li><li><u>Submitter information</u>: An email address is required for the report submitter in case AvyEyes needs to contact the submitter with questions, and to send notification of report submission. Report submitters are also required to self-assess their avalanche education/experience level.</li><li><u>Data fields</u>: Aside from the previously mentioned fields, only an area name and the date of the avalanche are required. However, report submitters are encouraged to enter as much information as is known about the avalanche and attach any available pictures of the avalanche (e.g. pictures of the crown, bed surface, accident scene, snow pit profiles, etc). <i>Please refer to the mouse-over help on any field label for an explanation of that field.</i></li><li><u>Submission & Email</u>: The avalanche report is immediately viewable after submission. Upon successful submission an email is sent to the specified email address providing links for publicly sharing the avalanche report and for editing the report. Avalanche reports may be edited for up to seven (7) days after submission.</li></ul>
msg.aboutHelpContent=<p><u>What</u>:</p><p>AvyEyes is a graphical, searchable database of avalanches.</p><p>The primary piece of data in AvyEyes is the avalanche location. The avalanche path is drawn on the map by the avalanche report submitter and displayed three-dimensionally to anyone searching for avalanches at a given location. Avalanche reports are also directly sharable/linkable with short URLs or social plugins.</p><p><span style="font-size: .9em; font-style: italic;"><u>Accuracy Disclaimer</u>: Avalanche paths in AvyEyes are drawn freehand by the report submitter using the mouse. Avalanche paths are NOT derived from GPS coordinates or any other precise form of survey/measurement. Therefore the avalanche paths displayed on AvyEyes can be assumed to contain some degree of inaccuracy resulting from the report submitter misremembering the exact path shape or rendering it inaccurately.</span></p><p><u>Why</u>:</p><p>The driving purpose behind AvyEyes is to enable people to <i>visualize</i> avalanches. By requiring the report submitter to draw the avalanche path on the map, AvyEyes records the geographic location of the avalanche. And by allowing the user to zoom, tilt, rotate, and fly around avalanches in 3D, AvyEyes gives the user a new way to look at avalanches and share avalanche reports.</p><p>AvyEyes is intended to be a collaborative and educational tool for the backcountry community. The hope is that AvyEyes will foster communication and knowledge-sharing between both novice and experienced backcountry travelers by showing which slopes have historically produced what types of avalanches.</p><p><u>Contact</u>:</p><p>Send questions, comments, or ideas for improvement to <a href='mailto:avyeyes@gmail.com'>avyeyes@gmail.com</a></p>
