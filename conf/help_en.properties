help.roAvyFormRecentSnow=The amount of snow that fell at the avalanche location during the week preceding the slide.
help.roAvyFormRecentWindSpeed=<p>The <i>predominant</i> wind speed and direction at the avalanche location during the week preceding the slide. If the predominant wind changed significantly during the week prior to the avalanche, these fields note the wind closer to the day of the avalanche.</p><p>Wind speed is measured on the Beaufort scale.</p>

// report
help.avyReportInitLocation=A well-known location in the vicinity of the avalanche
help.rwAvyFormViewable=Whether or not this avalanche report is approved and viewable by the public
help.rwAvyFormAreaName=<p>The common or well-known name of the location where the avalanche occurred.</p>For example: "West side of Jones Pass" or "NE face of Mt. Wilson"
help.rwAvyFormDate=<p>The date of the avalanche.</p>Provide an approximate date if the exact date is not known.
help.rwAvyFormRecentSnow=The amount of snow that fell (in centimeters) at the avalanche location during the week preceding the slide.
help.rwAvyFormRecentWindSpeed=<p>The <i>predominant</i> wind speed and direction at the avalanche location during the week preceding the slide. If the predominant wind changed significantly during the week prior to the avalanche, note the wind characteristics closer to the day of the avalanche. Wind speed is measured on the Beaufort scale:</p><ul><li>Calm - less than 1 km/hour or .7 mph. Smoke rises vertically</li><li>Light breeze - 5-12 km/hour or 3-7 mph. Leaves rustle, wind vanes begin to move</li><li>Moderate breeze - 20-29 km/hour or 12-18 mph. Small branches begin to move</li><li>Strong breeze - 39-50 km/hour or 24-31 mph. Large branches in motion</li><li>Gale - 62-75 km/hour or 38-46 mph. Twigs broken from trees, progress on foot becomes difficult</li><li>Storm - 88-102 km/hour or 55-64 mph. Trees are broken off or uprooted, structural damage likely</li></ul><p>Wind direction is always the direction that the wind came <i>from</i>. For example, a NW wind blew from the northwest toward the southeast.</p>
