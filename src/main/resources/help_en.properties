help.avySearchLocation=Where to begin the search. Only avalanches that are viewable in the current Google Earth window when the 'Search' button is clicked will be displayed.
help.avySearchFromDate=The start date for the search. Only avalanches that occurred <i>on or after</i> this date will be displayed.<br/>Leaving the start date blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchToDate=The end date for the search. Only avalanches that occurred <i>on or before</i> this date will be displayed.<br/>Leaving the end date blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchType=The type classification of the avalanche. Only avalanches of the specified type will be displayed.<br/>Leaving the type blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchTrigger=The mechanism that caused the avalanche to release. Triggers are either natural (N* codes) or artificial (A* codes). Only avalanches with the specified trigger will be displayed.<br/>Leaving the trigger blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchRsizeValue=The relative (R) size of the avalanche. A R1 avalanche is very small relative to its path. A R5 avalanche encompasses all or nearly all of its path.<br>Only avalanches that have a R size value <i>equal to or greater than</i> the specified R size will be displayed.<br>Leaving the R size blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchDsizeValue=The destructive (D) size of the avalanche. A D1 avalanche is relatively harmless to people. A D4 avalanche could destroy a railway car and a D5 avalanche can substantially gouge landscape.<br>Only avalanches that have a D size value <i>equal to or greater than</i> the specified D size will be displayed.<br>Leaving the D size blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchNumCaught=The number of humans caught in the avalanche. Only avalanches that caught <i>greater than or equal to</i> this number of people will be displayed.<br>Leaving this value blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchNumKilled=The number of humans killed in the avalanche. Only avalanches that killed <i>greater than or equal to</i> this number of people will be displayed.<br>Leaving this value blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.

// details
help.avyDetailsType=The type classification of the avalanche.
help.avyDetailsTrigger=The trigger classification of the avalanche. I.e. the mechanism that caused the avalanche to release. Triggers are either natural (N* codes) or artificial (A* codes).
help.avyDetailsInterface=The interface classification of the avalanche. I.e. the bed surface on which the avalanche slid.
help.avyDetailsRSize=The relative (R) size of the avalanche. A R1 avalanche is very small relative to its path. A R5 avalanche encompasses all or nearly all of its path.
help.avyDetailsDSize=The destructive (D) size of the avalanche. A D1 avalanche is relatively harmless to people. A D4 avalanche could destroy a railway car and a D5 avalanche can substantially gouge landscape.
help.avyDetailsElevation=The elevation at the top of the avalanche path.
help.avyDetailsAspect=The aspect of the avalanche path.
help.avyDetailsAngle=The slope angle of the avalanche path.


// report
help.avyReportAreaName=The common or well-known name of the location where the avalanche occurred. 
help.avyReportDate=The date of the avalanche.<br/>Provide an approximate date if the exact date is not known.
help.avyReportSky=The sky cover <i>at the time of the avalanche</i>. Select 'Unknown' if sky cover is not known.
help.avyReportPrecip=The precipitation <i>at the time of the avalanche</i>. Select 'Unknown' if precipitation is not known.
help.avyReportType=The type classification of the avalanche. Select 'Unknown' if you are not sure of the avalanche type.
help.avyReportTrigger=The mechanism that caused the avalanche to release. Select 'Unknown' if you are not sure of the avalanche trigger.
help.avyReportBedSurface=The interface or bed surface on which the avalanche slid. Select 'Unknown' if you are not sure of the avalanche interface.
help.avyReportRsizeValue=The relative (R) size of the avalanche. Leave the value at 0 (zero) if you are not sure of the R size.
help.avyReportDsizeValue=The destructive (D) size of the avalanche. Leave the value at 0 (zero) if you are not sure of the D size.
help.avyReportElevation=The elevation at the top of the avalanche path.<br/>This value is pre-populated from the avalanche drawing and is not modifiable.
help.avyReportAspect=The aspect of the avalanche path.<br/>This value is pre-populated from the avalanche drawing, but it is modifiable if you disagree with the pre-populated value.
help.avyReportAngle=The slope angle of the avalanche path.<br/>This value is pre-populated from the avalanche drawing, but it is modifiable if you disagree with the pre-populated value.
help.avyReportNumCaught=The number of humans caught <i>to any degree</i> in the avalanche.<br/>Leave empty if unknown. A 0 (zero) value means no people were caught. An empty value means you don't know.
help.avyReportNumPartiallyBuried=The number of humans partially (not fully) buried in the avalanche.<br/>Leave empty if unknown. A 0 (zero) value means no people were partially buried. An empty value means you don't know.
help.avyReportNumFullyBuried=The number of humans fully (not partially) buried in the avalanche.<br/>Leave empty if unknown. A 0 (zero) value means no people were fully buried. An empty value means you don't know.
help.avyReportNumInjured=The number of humans injured (not killed) in the avalanche.<br/>Leave empty if unknown. A 0 (zero) value means no people were injured. An empty value means you don't know.
help.avyReportNumKilled=The number of humans killed (not injured) in the avalanche.<br/>Leave empty if unknown. A 0 (zero) value means no people were killed. An empty value means you don't know.
help.avyReportModeOfTravel=The primary mode of travel used by the group that triggered the avalanche (if it was triggered by humans). Select 'Unknown' if you are not sure of the primary mode of travel.
