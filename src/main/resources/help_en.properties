help.avySearchLocation=Where to begin the search. Only avalanches that are viewable in the current Google Earth window when the 'Search' button is clicked will be displayed.
help.avySearchFromDate=The start date for the search. Only avalanches that occurred <i>on or after</i> this date will be displayed.<br/>Leaving the start date blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchToDate=The end date for the search. Only avalanches that occurred <i>on or before</i> this date will be displayed.<br/>Leaving the end date blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchType=The type classification of the avalanche. Only avalanches of the specified type will be displayed.<br/>Leaving the type blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchTrigger=The mechanism that caused the avalanche to release. Triggers are either natural (N* codes) or artificial (A* codes). Only avalanches with the specified trigger will be displayed.<br/>Leaving the trigger blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchRsizeValue=The relative (R) size of the avalanche. A R1 avalanche is very small relative to its path. A R5 avalanche encompasses all or nearly all of its path.<br>Only avalanches that have a R size value <i>equal to or greater than</i> the specified R size will be displayed.<br>Leaving the R size blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchDsizeValue=The destructive (D) size of the avalanche. A D1 avalanche is relatively harmless to people. A D4 avalanche could destroy a railway car and a D5 avalanche can substantially gouge landscape.<br>Only avalanches that have a D size value <i>equal to or greater than</i> the specified D size will be displayed.<br>Leaving the D size blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchNumCaught=The number of humans caught in the avalanche. Only avalanches that caught <i>greater than or equal to</i> this number of people will be displayed.<br>Leaving this value blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
help.avySearchNumKilled=The number of humans killed in the avalanche. Only avalanches that killed <i>greater than or equal to</i> this number of people will be displayed.<br>Leaving this value blank will exclude it as a criteria of the search.
