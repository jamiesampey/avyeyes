msg.searchHelpContent=<u>The first piece of search criteria is the current Google Earth view.</u><br/>Only avalanches that are visible in the current Google Earth view will be returned from a search. Additionally, the view must be zoomed in to no more than 15,000 feet above the ground when searching.<br/></br><u>Dates</u>: Only avalanches that occurred within the bounding dates (inclusive of the 'from' and 'to' date) will be returned. Leaving the 'from' date blank will return avalanches back to Jan. 1 1970; leaving the 'to' date blank will return avalanches up to today.<br/><u>Type and Trigger</u>: If specified, only avalanches with the exact type and trigger codes will be returned. Leaving either field empty will return avalanches with any type/trigger.<br/><u>R/D size</u>: If specified, only avalanches with an R/D size <i>greater than or equal to</i> the specified value will be returned. Leaving R/D size blank will return avalanches of any size.<br/><u>Caught and Killed Human Numbers</u>: If specified, only avalanches that caught or killed <i>greater than or equal to</i> the specified number of humans will be returned. Leaving either field empty will return avalanches that caught or killed any number of humans (including those that did not catch/kill any humans).<br/>Each search field may be independently specified or left blank. If multiple fields are specified they are combined with a boolean 'and' to produce the aggregate search criteria.<br/><br/><u>Example 1</u>: A 'from' date of 12/1/2005 is entered along with an R size of 2. All other fields are left blank. <u>Result</u>: Only avalanches that occurred within the current Google Earth view after December 1, 2005 with an R size greater than or equal to 2 will be displayed.<br/><u>Example 2</u>: A 'from' date of 11/25/2008, a 'to' date of 3/27/2012, a type value of 'HS - Hard Slab Avalanche', a trigger value of 'AS - Skier' and a caught value of 1 are specified. All other fields are left blank. <u>Result</u>: All hard slab avalanches that occurred within the current view between November 25, 2008 and March 27, 2012 that were skier-triggered and caught at least 1 human will be displayed.

msg.aboutHelpContent=Avy Eyes is an open, graphical, searchable database of avalanches.<br/>The primary piece of data in Avy Eyes is the avalanche location, which is drawn in the Google Earth window by the avalanche report submitter and displayed three-dimensionally to anyone searching for avalanches. Anyone can submit an avalanche report, and once a report is given a basic review it will be viewable to anyone else searching for avalanches at a given location.<br/>Avalanche reports are also directly sharable/linkable with short avalanche-specific URLs.<br/><br/>Avy Eyes is intended to be a collaborative and educational tool for the backcountry community. The hope is to foster communication and knowledge sharing between both novice and experienced backcountry travelers by showing which slopes have historically produced what types of avalanches in which conditions.<br/>Send questions, comments, or ideas for improvement to <a href='mailto:avyeyes@gmail.com'>avyeyes@gmail.com</a><br/>Avy Eyes was written by Jamie Sampey in Golden, Colorado.
