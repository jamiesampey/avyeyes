msg.browserNotSupported=<p>Avy Eyes is not supported on this browser. Avy Eyes requires one of the following:<br/><ul><li>Firefox version %.1f or greater</li><li>Opera version %.1f or greater</li><li>Safari version %.1f or greater</li><li>Internet Explorer version %.1f or greater (with 32-bit Compatibility View)</li><li>Chrome version %.1f <span style="color: red;">&#42;</span></li></ul></p><span style="color: red;">&#42;</span> Avy Eyes uses the <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/explore/products/plugin.html">Google Earth Plug-in</a> to display avalanches three-dimensionally. The Google Earth Plug-in is a 32-bit NPAPI application and Chrome dropped support for the NPAPI after Chrome version 35. Read here: <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html">Saying Goodbye to Our Old Friend NPAPI</a>.</p><p>Hopefully at some point in the future Avy Eyes will run on a WebGL-powered javascript 3D earth and not require the Google Earth Plug-in (i.e. it will run entirely in the browser). However there are currently limited technical options in the WebGL earth/terrain arena and no options with a robust javascript API. So in short, the Google Earth Plug-in is currently the best option.

msg.searchHelpContent=<u>The first piece of search criteria is the current Google Earth view!</u><p>Only avalanches that are visible in the current Google Earth view will be returned from a search. Additionally, the view must be zoomed in to no more than 8,000 meters (~26,000 feet) above the ground when searching.</p><p><u>Search Fields</u></p><p><u>Dates</u>: Only avalanches that occurred within the bounding dates (inclusive of the 'from' and 'to' date) will be returned. Leaving the 'from' date blank will return avalanches back to Jan. 1 1970; leaving the 'to' date blank will return avalanches up to today.</p><p><u>Type and Trigger</u>: If specified, only avalanches with the exact type and trigger codes will be returned. Leaving either field empty will return avalanches with any type/trigger.</p><p><u>R/D size</u>: If specified, only avalanches with an R/D size <i>greater than or equal to</i> the specified value will be returned. Leaving R/D size blank will return avalanches of any size.</p><p><u>Caught and Killed Human Numbers</u>: If specified, only avalanches that caught or killed <i>greater than or equal to</i> the specified number of humans will be returned. Leaving either field empty will return avalanches that caught or killed any number of humans (including those that did not catch/kill any humans).</p><p>Each search field may be independently specified or left blank. If multiple fields are specified they are combined with a boolean 'and' to produce the aggregate search criteria.</p><br/><p><u>Example 1</u>: A 'from' date of 12/1/2005 is entered along with an R size of 2. All other fields are left blank. <u>Result</u>: Only avalanches that occurred within the current Google Earth view after December 1, 2005 with an R size greater than or equal to 2 will be displayed.</p><p><u>Example 2</u>: A 'from' date of 11/25/2008, a 'to' date of 3/27/2012, a type value of 'HS - Hard Slab Avalanche', a trigger value of 'AS - Skier' and a caught value of 1 are specified. All other fields are left blank. <u>Result</u>: All hard slab avalanches that occurred within the current view between November 25, 2008 and March 27, 2012 that were skier-triggered and caught at least 1 human will be displayed.</p>
msg.reportHelpContent=<p>There are two parts to submitting an avalanche report: 1) drawing the avalanche path on the map, and 2) entering the avalanche details.</p><p><u>Drawing the avalanche path</u></p><p>The primary piece of data in Avy Eyes is the avalanche location/path, so the first step is to draw the avalanche path on the map with your mouse. Avy Eyes takes you through a three-step wizard to draw the avalanche path on the map:<ol><li><u>Step 1</u> is to prime the map by entering a nearby location (so as to minimize the amount of manual zooming required in step 2).</li><li><u>Step 2</u> is to actually draw the avalanche on the map with your mouse. Once you click "Begin Drawing" the mouse is set to draw and will begin drawing with the next left-click on the map. Trace the perimeter of the avalanche path and left-click a second time to complete the drawing. During this time you can still left-click on the Google Earth controls in the upper right to zoom/pan/tilt the map without beginning the drawing.</li><li><u>Step 3</u> is to accept the avalanche drawing or choose to redraw the avalanche path if the drawing doesn't look right. You can redraw as many times as needed to get the drawing right. Once you click "Accept Drawing" you will be taken to the report details entry screen and will not have a chance to redraw the path.</li></ol></p>Here is a good example of a zoomed in view and avalanche drawing:<br/><img src="/images/example-drawing.jpg"/></p><p><u>Entering the avalanche details</u></p><p>Once you have accepted the avalanche drawing the avalanche details screen is displayed. The aspect, angle, and elevation are pre-populated based on the drawn avalanche path. The aspect and angle are best guesses based on the drawing, but are also editable in case the estimated values are slightly off. The elevation is certain based on the drawing and is not editable.</p><p>There are seven required fields denoted with a red asterisk. An email address is required for the report submitter in case Avy Eyes needs to contact the submitter with questions, and to notify the submitter of the report submission and approval.</p><p>Report submitters are also required to self-assess their avalanche education/experience level. Only 1) on-snow professionals with significant avalanche education and 2) professional avalanche forecasters or technicians are allowed to enter the technical classification details of the avalanche (type, trigger, interface, R/D size).</p><p>Report submitters are encouraged to input as much information as is known about the avalanche and attach any available pictures of the avalanche (e.g. pictures of the crown, bed surface, accident scene, snow pit profiles, etc). Please refer to the mouse-over help on any field label for an explanation of that field.</p><p>Once the report is submitted an Avy Eyes administrator will review the report and either approve or reject it. If the report is approved it will be viewable at the noted URL and returned in avalanche search results.</p>
msg.aboutHelpContent=<u>What</u>:<p>Avy Eyes is an open, graphical, searchable database of avalanches.</p><p>The primary piece of data in Avy Eyes is the avalanche location. The avalanche path is drawn in the Google Earth window by the avalanche report submitter and displayed three-dimensionally to anyone searching for avalanches at a given location. Avalanche reports are given a basic review, and once approved they are viewable to anyone searching for avalanches at a given location.</p><p>Individual avalanche reports are also directly sharable/linkable with short URLs and social plugins.</p><br/><u>Why</u>:<p>Avy Eyes is intended to be a collaborative and educational tool for the backcountry community. The hope is to foster communication and knowledge sharing between both novice and experienced backcountry travelers by showing which slopes have historically produced what types of avalanches in which conditions.</p><p>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.</p><br/><u>Contact</u>:<p>Send questions, comments, or ideas for improvement to <a href='mailto:avyeyes@gmail.com'>avyeyes@gmail.com</a></p>

msg.avyReportDrawStep1Instruction=<p>Begin the avalanche report by tracing the avalanche path in the Google Earth view. To do this you must first zoom the view in as close as possible to the exact slope/aspect that slid.</p><p>To start zooming in, use the location field below to fly to the general area of the avalanche. This will decrease the amount of zooming/panning required in the next step.</p><p>Good locations to use are nearby towns, mountain passes (Vail Pass, Stevens Pass, etc), or well-known mountains (Mt. Elbert, Mt. Rainier, etc).</p>
msg.avyReportDrawStep2Instruction=<p>Now use the Google Earth controls on the upper right to zoom in the rest of the way.</p><p>Zoom and tilt the view as much as possible to get a complete view of the avalanche path while still keeping the <u>entire</u> path visible in the window (see the example below).</p><p>Once you click the "Begin Drawing" button below the mouse is set to draw and will begin tracing the avalanche path perimeter on the next left-click in the Google Earth view. However you can still zoom/rotate/tilt the view using the controls in the upper right without beginning to draw.</p><p>One left-click begins your trace of the avalanche path perimeter and a second left-click completes the perimeter trace.</p><img src="/images/example-drawing.jpg" width="450"/>
